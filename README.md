# Experimentation-Spectral-Clustering

An experimental study was performed in order to evaluate:
(i) the choice of an adequate similarity matrix setting as input of the NJW algorithm;
(ii) the strategy to automatically determine the number of clusters in
data proposed by the DiFUZZY algorithm. This discussion was supported
by an experimental study that involves synthetic and real datasets. 

The study conducted using matlab. The detailed report can be seen here:
